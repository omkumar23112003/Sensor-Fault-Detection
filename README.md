üõ†Ô∏è Sensor Fault Detection Machine Learning Project
üì¢ Overview
This project implements an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline for real-time wafer sensor fault detection.
It uses automated data ingestion, preprocessing, model training & selection, and provides an interactive prediction interface via a Flask-based web app.

The goal is to help manufacturers quickly determine whether wafers from sensor readings are faulty or normal, ensuring high-quality production and reducing defects.

üöÄ Features
Upload Data for Prediction:
Web interface to upload CSV sensor data and instantly get predictions.

Complete ML Pipeline:

Data ingestion and validation

Data cleaning, scaling, and feature engineering

Multiple model training & best model selection

Real-time prediction on uploaded data

Continual model retraining for improved accuracy

Multiple Algorithms Tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks

Robust Model Evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.
