🧠 Wafer Fault Detection Project


🕹️ Overview


Welcome to the Wafer Fault Detection project! This repository provides a robust, end-to-end machine learning pipeline for automatically detecting faulty wafers in semiconductor manufacturing using real sensor data. The main objective is to classify each wafer as Good (1) or Bad (-1) based on 590+ readings from the fabrication process.

Goal: Predict wafer quality in real-time for higher production yield and lower waste.

Type: Supervised Binary Classification

Tech: Python, Machine Learning, Flask, Clean Modular Architecture ⚙️

📋 Problem Statement
Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a semiconductor wafer is "Good" or "Bad" based on the sensor readings collected during the fabrication process.

Input: 590 sensor readings per wafer (Sensor-1, ..., Sensor-590)

Output: “Good” (1) or “Bad” (-1)

Business Impact:

Early fault detection reduces losses, increases manufacturing throughput, and enables rapid action.



🌟 Features
🔧 Modular & Clean Code: Easily extensible and production-ready Python codebase.

📊 Data Ingestion & Processing: Handles raw incoming CSV data, cleaning, scaling, and feature engineering.

🏋️♂️ Model Training: Supports a variety of classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks).

🧪 Full ML Pipeline Automation: End-to-end automation from ingestion to deployment.

🖥️ Real-Time Prediction: Predict wafer quality instantly via a web interface.

📝 Robust Logging: Centralized, detailed logging and error handling.

🔁 Continuous Learning: Supports feedback loops and retraining.

☁️ Web Deployment: RESTful API via Flask (app.py) with custom HTML upload UI.

🖌️ Customizable UI: Polished CSS for an attractive file upload experience.

🏷️ Data Details
File Format: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

Features: 590+ sensor readings per wafer (Sensor-1, Sensor-2, ..., Sensor-590)

Target: Good (1) / Bad (-1)

# Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser
⬆️ Upload Data for Prediction
Use the provided web interface (templates/upload_file.html) to upload a CSV and see wafer predictions.

🔬 Project Workflow
Data Ingestion: Reads and validates raw wafer sensor data.

Preprocessing: Cleans NaNs, scales features, and engineers new columns if needed.

Model Training: Trains the model using multiple algorithms, selects the best based on evaluation.

Prediction: Applies the trained model to uploaded data for real-time wafer fault detection.

Continuous Update: Retrain with new production batches for higher accuracy.

📈 ML Approach
Cleaning: Removes outliers, normalizes values, imputes missing data.

Feature Engineering: Sophisticated derivation from raw sensor streams.

Model Selection: Trains and compares Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network models.

Evaluation: Uses Precision, Recall, F1, Confusion Matrix, etc., for assessment.

Deployment: REST API with Flask for real-time classification, easily portable for production.
